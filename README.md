## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to place different elements on my page more efficiently, and how to use layers with z-index. I think I'm a little better to organize my code. 
I didn't use JS, I use the requested property for the email input, but can't be able to change the displayed message when the field is empty or invalid format.

### Continued development

I need to improve my responsive skills, and knowledge about absolute and relative position.


### Useful resources

- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Use for some information about the requested input.
